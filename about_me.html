                            I began my career as a 10th grade high school English teacher in Lake County, Florida. Those years were formative to me, as I learned how to be a teacher and a member of a school community. I taught during the early years of No Child Left Behind Act, and our school was consistently rated as "needing improvement" and threatened with school improvement protocols. As I progressed through my education and then as a professor, I remember those days well and carry them with me into each class I teach.

                            Teaching and learning have always been the focal point of my career. I have maintained that focus from being a high school English teacher to becoming professor and now directing academic programs and leading initiatives. As I keep growing in the profession, I am very interested in becoming the executive director of a teaching center, as it will allow me to keep teaching and learning central to my work.

                            Conducting research is core to my work. As a scholar, I am passionate about the digital pedagogies, which are ways that we can use technology for instructional purposes. Through my research, I work to identify impactful strategies for using technology to drive student learning, which has led me into the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. Over the next few years, I plan to formalize my work in SOTL and become a national leader in the field.
